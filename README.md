# RB Server

Even when working in a gRPC-based services-oriented environment, it can sometimes be helpful to start an HTTP Server.
In my context, I needed a way to handle simple GET requests for mechanisms such as callbacks or any kind of "notification"
request that shouldn't go through an API gateway.

I knew I should write this HTTP server in Ruby, the primary programming language used in my company.
However, I didn't know if I should use Puma, Unicorn, Thin, or any other servers available in the Ruby ecosystem.
That's why I choose to prototype a common HTTP Server class.
